tidykml 0.1.1 (2016-12-31)
--------------------------

This version has been tested against GADM (gadm.org) files -- with very mixed 
success: maps with inner boundaries will not render appropriately, and detailed
maps will take a long time to process.

FIXES

* Deal with whitespace in <coordinates> elements.

CHANGES

* Support for files with no <Folder> element(s).

* Support for KMZ sources.
