\title{Read a KML file.}
\usage{
kml_read(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A string, a connection, or a raw vector.
All inputs accepted by \link[xml2:read_xml]{read_xml} are also accepted, as 
long as they are valid KML. This means that URLs and local compressed files,
such as \code{.zip} files, are also supported. 

If the source is a local file with a name ending in \code{.kmz}, 
\code{kml_read} will treat it as a zipped KML file and will try to read its
first file, as listed by \link[utils:unzip]{unzip}.

If the source is a link to Google My Maps, \code{kml_read} will try to 
download the most recent version of the map and will then treat it as a 
\code{.kmz} file.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \link[xml2:read_xml]{read_xml}, such as 
\code{encoding} or \code{base_url}.
See \link[xml2:read_xml]{read_xml} for details.}

A nodeset.
